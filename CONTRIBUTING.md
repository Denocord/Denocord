# Contributing to Denocord
Thank you for your interest in contributing to Denocord. We have some rules set in order to keep the code as clean as possible. Some of these rules are enforced automatically using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). 

## Code style
We use Deno's native tools to format the code. In order to lint the code, run `deno fmt .`.

## Documenting public APIs
Currently, no APIs are documented, however, please, when adding something that is not private, please, document it using TSDoc.

## Adding/modifying features
Before adding/modifying features, please check whether a [pull request](https://github.com/Denocord/Denocord/pulls) is already present for this feature.  
When adding a new feature, please check whether the feature you'd like to work on isn't already worked on. If it isn't worked on, it is recommended to consult the feature with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/gS757SV).
